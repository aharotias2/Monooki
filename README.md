# Monooki
light weight simple command line application for backup your directories or files

## Motivation
I have used rsync to backup my files but I wonder how it works and I don't know the detail.
So I decided to create a new one for my needs.

## Usage
execute a command like below:

    $ com.github.aharotias2.Monooki dirA dirB dirC destination

Same as the cp and rsync commands.

Copy the directories dirA, dirB, and dirC to the destination directory.

If a file with the same name already exists, it will not be overwritten unless it has been updatedã€‚

You can specify the backup source by writing the path to the file with the -i option.

The --dry-run option only prints stdout the filename to be copied without doing the actual copy.

## Compile
It use meson as build system.
At first execute `meson build` command to create build environment. 
it will make a directory named `build` then cd into it and run `ninja` command to compile the Monooki.

    $ meson build
    $ cd build
    $ ninja

Then there is `com.github.aharotias2.Monooki` that is the final result of this process.
Copy it some location where included in the `PATH` environmental variable for installation.

I recommend you to register this command in your crontab scheduling list to constantly backup your important files.

Good luck.
